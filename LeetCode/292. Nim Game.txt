Nim Games
1 One Pile Nim Games
Consider the following two-person game.
• There are initially n stones on the table.
• During a move a player can remove either one, two, or three stones.
• If a player cannot move then he loses (this only happens when there
are 0 stones on the table).
Notation 1.1 We denote this game (1, 2, 3)-NIM.
Before reading on, think about how you should play this game to win
starting with a pile of, say, 21 stones.
Strategy: It is clear that if there are only one, two, or three stones left
(on your turn), you can win the game by taking all of them. If, however,
there are exactly four stones you will lose, because no matter how many you
take, you will leave one, two, or three and your opponent will win by taking
the remainder. If there are five, six, or seven stones you can win by taking
just enough to leave four stones. If there are eight stones you will again lose,
because you must leave five, six, or seven. Etc.
Here is the win/loss information for take one-two-or-three for up to 21
stones.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

In general, if there are a multiple of four stones you lose. Otherwise you win
(by taking enough stones to leave a multiple of four for your opponent). So
we see the pattern LWWW, which is repeated. Thus, 21 stones is a win: take
one stone.
