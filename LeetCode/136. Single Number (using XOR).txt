XOR Property
-------------
for N in decimal base,
0^N = N
N^N = 0

So, if XOR of a number is  performed even (two, four, six, eight, ten, etc.) times,  it becomes 0,
but, if XOR of a number is  performed odd times it becomes N

let, result = 0
As, input section has clarified that,  every element appears twice except for one element.
So, if we perform XOR for all elements of the array and store the result inside "result" variable, only unique element will be stored at "result".
